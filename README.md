# September 2018: New Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech SDK available

We released a new Speech SDK supporting the new [Speech Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/speech-services). The new Speech SDK comes with support for Windows, Android, Linux, Javascript and iOS.

Please check out [Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech SDK](https://aka.ms/csspeech) for documentation, links to the download pages, and the samples.


>NOTE: The content of this repository is supporting the [Bing Speech Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/Speech/Home), not the new [Speech Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/speech-services). Bing Speech Service has been deprecated, please use the new Speech Service.


# Microsoft Speech API: Android Speech-to-Text Client Library and Samples

## The Client Library

The Speech To Text client library is a client library for Microsoft Speech, Speech-to-text API.

The easiest way to consume the client library is to add the `com.microsoft.projectoxford:speechrecognition` package from Maven Central Repository. To find the latest version of client library, go to http://search.maven.org, and search for "g:com.microsoft.projectoxford".

To add the client library dependency from build.gradle file, add the following line in dependencies.

```
dependencies {
    //
    // Use the following line to include client library from Maven Central Repository
    // Change the version number from the search.maven.org result
    //
    compile 'com.microsoft.projectoxford:speechrecognition:1.2.2'

    // Your other Dependencies...
}
```

To add the client library dependency from Android Studio:

1. From Menu, Choose `File` \> `Project Structure`.
2. Click on your app module.
3. Click on `Dependencies` tab.
4. Click "+" sign to add new dependency.
5. Pick `Library dependency` from the drop-down list.
6. Type `com.microsoft.projectoxford` and hit the search icon from `Choose Library Dependency` dialog.
7. Pick the client library that you intend to use.
8. Click `OK` to add the new dependency.
9. Download the appropriate JNI library `libandroid_platform.so` from [this page](https://github.com/Microsoft/Cognitive-Speech-STT-Android/tree/master/SpeechSDK/libs) and put into your project's directory `app/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi/` or `app/src/main/jniLibs/x86/`.

## The Sample

This sample demonstrates the following features using a wav file or external microphone input:

* Short-form recognition
* Long-form dictation
* Recognition with intent

### Requirements

* Android OS must be Android 4.1 or higher (API Level 16 or higher)
* The speech client library contains native code. To use this sample in an emulator, make sure that your build variant matches the architecture (x86 or arm) of your emulator.

### Build the sample

1. First, you must obtain a Speech API subscription key by following the instructions on [Subscriptions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/try/cognitive-services/).

2. Start Android Studio, choose `Import project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc.)` from the `Quick Start` options and select Cognitive-Speech-STT-Android folder.

3. When a `Gradle Sync` dialog pops up, choose OK to continue downloading the latest tools.

4. In Android Studio -\> `Project` panel -\> `Android` view, open file "SpeechRecoExample/res/values/strings.xml", and find the line "Please\_add\_the\_subscription\_key\_here;". Replace the "Please\_add\_the\_subscription\_key\_here" value with your subscription key from the first step.

5. If you want to use *Recognition with intent*, you also need to sign up for [Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/language-understanding-intelligent-service/) and set the key values in `luisAppID` and `luisSubscriptionID` in Samples\_SpeechRecoExample\_res\_values\_strings.xml.

6. In Android Studio, select menu `Build` \> `Make Project` to build the sample, and `Run` to launch this sample app.

### Running the sample

In Android Studio, select menu `Run`, and `Run app` to launch this sample app.

1. In the application, press the button `Select Mode` to select what type of speech recognition you would like to use.

2. To start recognition, press the `Start` button.
